This is just a tiny wrapper that allows you to use the "Car Racing" environment
from Farama Gymnasium inside of a C++ program. I just threw this together really
fast using claude because I needed it for a project.

=== Building and running
========================

An example app is provided. To build and run it, you will need the Python
development headers installed on your system. Then install some dependencies
with pip, inside of a virtualenv:

  $ python -m venv .venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Do the standard CMake procedure:

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

Then run the example:

  $ ./example
